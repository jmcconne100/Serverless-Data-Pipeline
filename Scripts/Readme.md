# Test Environment Bash Script for working in Linux

This bash script is available for using the fake_data_cli script.

It quickly installs python3, pip, and a collection of other libraries for running the cli version of the lambda script.

It includes logic for quick install on multiple linux systems and other libraries so this script can be integrated with others reliably.
